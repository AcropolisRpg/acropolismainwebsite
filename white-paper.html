						<h5 class="w3l-subtitle">- About Us</h5>
						<p>We are a dev team working to bring a new experience on the blockchain by creating an open world with self driving economy allowing players to bring value from all the actions inside the game to not be just another unsuccessful "play to earn game"</p>
					</div>
				</div> 
				<div class="clearfix"> </div>

				<h1>Introducing Acropolis MMORPG</h1>
				<p>Acropolis takes its name from ancient Greek, an Acropolis was a city built in the highest part of a terrain to 
					give military advantages, protection, scale up buildings faster, to protect and move resources 
					between every city in the safest possible way, meaning that Acropolis MMORPG will take all those 
					advantages and bring them to the game.</p>

					
					<p>The purpose is to allow players immerse themselves in this world with the role of a Citizen of 
						the Acropolis, trading their goods, gathering resources, fighting other players to get better resources. 
						Then every City inside the game will have their own market based on player actions and efforts. 
					</p>
					<p>
						At Acropolis MMORPG, we believe that having unique assets, unique character and freedom, is one of 
						the ways to make a game appealing and engaging, with the advantage of rewarding players to translate their effort to an NFT. 
					</p>
					<p>The intention behind Acropolis MMORPG is to build a solid decentralized economy that will be built organically 
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jumbotron">
				<h1>Sight and Universe of Acropolis</h1>
				<p>As of this writing, NFTs and blockchain are gaining widespread popularity across different aspects of life. and we 
					believe this is happening for a good reason, at least for Acropolis MMORPG. NFTs are used in Acropolis MMORPG because
					we trust that player effort has a value that can be translated to NFTs, and of course this is something that traditional 
					games can't bring to current market</p>
					
					<p>The value lies in the effort and the ownership of these effort that every player will place in the game, allowing them
						to acquire in-game components. Within Acropolis MMORPG, each player will be able to build their own path, meaning
						they will have unique stats among every other player, and different kind of in-game components that can be traded from
						inside and outside of Acropolis world. 
					</p>
					<p>
						By allowing these in-game components to be moved from the inside world to the outside world players can be rewarded by 
						the effort they invest for someone else looking to save some time, or get some unique in-game components. 
					</p>
					<p>Acropolis will be a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing game, allowing every player to connect to each other, and 
						bring the Acropolis to life, they will be the souls that will be moving in-game components inside the Acropolis. 
					</p>

					<p>Our intended Audience is every player that is looking to play, and enjoy a unique experience that will be rewarded inside 
						and outside Acropolis MMORPG, we are looking to bring a different meaning of the current status of play to Earn allowing 
						players to trade their goods at a free market. 
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jumbotron">
				<h1>Building Blocks of Acropolis</h1>
				<p>To start the game, each "future citizen" of Acropolis need to create and account and will be distributed an in-game avatar that 
					can be upgraded to an NFT. The account will be linked to a wallet for example Metamask, where the player will store their NFTs,
					and ACR Tokens. 
				</p>
					
					<p>Every player will be able to create any quantity of accounts allowing only a single player by each wallet. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To purchase in-game components like, potions, armament, and any other tradable item inside the game, players will be using the
						official Acropolis Token (ACR). 
					</p>
					<p>In the initial stages of Acropolis game development, players will be able to play at their browsers, and is recommended 
						to use a Desktop computer for the best experience. Our team will work to bring also the game for other platforms like mobile 
						devices being the first in the list Android devices. 
					</p>

					<p><strong>Biomes</strong>  is one of the key pieces for Acropolis MMORPG these will be zones with different kind of resources, at 
						the beginning Acropolis will have the next Biomes and more Biomes will be added as the game keeps growing. 
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Dessert</li>
						<li>Forest</li>
						<li>Frozen</li>
						<li>Swamp</li>
						<li>Tundra</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Every Biome will have a single city, and cities will be the place for players to trade their goods meaning they will have a market place, 
						every city will be a safe zone meaning players will not be able to attack other players inside cities. 
					</p>
					<p><strong>Zones</strong> players will be able to move free around the world and every zone will have a status indicating
					if is a safe place or if players will be able to attack other players.</p>
					<p><strong>Player vs Player (PVP)</strong> every player staying in danger zone can attack other player, to steal resources,
					or protect their friends. if your player is killed, the 100% of the items will have a probability to be destroyed, in case they
					are not destroyed the enemy will be able to take those items as a reward.</p>
					<p><strong>Server anti-cheating system</strong> Our system is running using an Authoritative server system, meaning everything 
					that happens inside the Acropolis is ruled by the Acropolis Servers, and every request like player movement, items transactions, 
				  will be validated at the server meaning that if the system detects some weird behavior it will flag and track those accounts,
					players will be able to report also unexpected behaviors and if those players are already flagged by the system they will be 
					candidates to be exiled from the Acropolis.</p>
					<p><strong>In-game Economy</strong> players will be able to trade their items at every market place on every city 
					of the Acropolis, the currency to enable trading will be the ACR Token, and they will be able to assign any price 
					for any item inside the game that they want to publish in the market place.</p>
					<p><strong>Experience Points</strong>players will get Experience points for the activity they are leveling up and experience will
						be also tied to the Biome where they are doing their activities, for example if a Player is gathering resources at Dessert
						if they try to gather the same resource at other Biome they will get less of that resource if the experience was higher
						in the previous Biome. This rule will apply for every Resource and Item inside the game also for crafting.</p>
					<p><strong>Resources and Items</strong> Resources will be able to be gathered inside the world from, trees, plants, monsters and dungeons,
					drop will be based depending on the level of the character meaning a higher level a better drop they will get for that resource.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jumbotron">
				<h1>Game Activities</h1>
				<p>The purpose of this section is to do a quick recap of the interaction of the building blocks of Acropolis MMORPG.</p>
					
					<p><strong>Level up</strong> one of the best activities a player can do is level up their characters and specialize them for a
						specific activity, this will make you better at hunting, gathering or any other activity you perform. .
					</p>
					<p> <strong>Gathering</strong> when leveling up you will get Resources and those resources will belong to specific biome
						meaning they will be harder to get in other biomes.
					</p>
					<p> <strong>Trading</strong> This will be one of the essential activities of Acropolis citizens, they will be able to trade
						their goods in the acropolis marketplace allowing you to get other kind of useful resources.
					</p>
					<p><strong>PVP</strong> Players will be able to kill other players in dangerous zones and the same rule of experience will apply 
						meaning they will get a better bonus if they kill or defeat other players everything inside this game is a trade, and your PVP 
						experience will be reduced if you are killed and promoted when you kill.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jumbotron">
				<h1>Play to Earn & Free to Play</h1>
				<p>Play to earn is really new in the gaming industry and we believe that the most important and valuable thing of this model 
					is the player itself</p>
					
					<p><strong>Model</strong> Every player and every item will be able to be crafted as NFT to be sold outside the game, 
						and the value of every item will be based in ACR, this will apply inside the game and outside the game marketplaces.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class="jumbotron">
				<h1>Tokenomics</h1>
				<p>Acropolis will have their own token, and it will be connected to Polygon Matic network.</p>
					
					<p><strong>$Acropolis (ACR)</strong> Acropolis token is a ERC-20 Polygon Matic Token.
					<p><strong>$Acropolis (ACR)</strong> Acropolis token is the native currency in Acropolis and there will be a max total supply 
						of 10,000,000 $ACR. Players and investors need $ACR to interact with the Acropolis.
					</p>
					<p><strong>$ACR Utilities:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Game Currency: that will be used for every transaction inside the game to buy and sell any kind of item, tokens transactions will be handled by our 
								servers matching your wallet with your current deposited amount inside the game, this will provide a faster experience. 
								You will be able always to transfer outside and inside the game your tokens.
							</li>
							<li>Hold $ACR one of the best ways to get value from $ACR is just by holding, because this token will not be Burned and minted.</li>
							<li>One $ACR to join the Acropolis you will have to Hold at least 1 $ACR in your wallet to be recognized as a citizen of the Acropolis.</li>
							<li>$ACR will have a fee for every trade transaction inside the game of 0.2% adjusted to a maximum of 2% and this will be based on the game volume, 
								the more volume the higher the fee, the lower the volume the lower the transaction fee, for example you will pay a tax for every 1,000 $ACR of 2 $ACR taxes 
								when the current fee is at 0.2% at the market and this will be displayed inside the game.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p><strong>Token Allocation:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>Airdrop 2022: 10,000 $ACR will be delivered free at Acropolis site depositing 1 $ACR to users that register a valid polygon wallet and an email. 0.1%
							</li>
							<li>Dev Team: 2,000,000 $ACR this will be destinated to continue the development and improvements of the project - 20%</li>
							<li>Marketing: 1,990,000 $ACR this will be destinated to continue the development and improvements of the project - 19.9%</li>
							<li>Players: 6,000,000 $ACR, for every player successfully joining into the game we will give you a 100 $ACR as an extra reward, 
								and we will spend this quantity of $ACR and display the current available in the official site - 60%</li>
							<li>Dex Liquidity: 200,000 $ACR - 2%</li>
							<li>$ACR will have a fee for every trade transaction inside the game of 0.2% adjusted to a maximum of 2% and this will be based on the game volume, 
								the more volume the higher the fee, the lower the volume the lower the transaction fee, for example you will pay a tax for every 1,000 $ACR of 2 $ACR taxes 
								when the current fee is at 0.2% at the market and this will be displayed inside the game.</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<div class="jumbotron">
						<h1>Blockchain</h1>
						<p>We are running the project under Polygon Matic because is one of the top blockchains and has one of the lowest transaction fees of the market, this
							has the advantage that your profits will be higher because the gas prices are cheaper than most of the top blockchains of the current market.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="jumbotron">
						<h1>Roadmap</h1>
